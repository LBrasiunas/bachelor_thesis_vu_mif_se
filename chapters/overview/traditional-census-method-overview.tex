\textbf{TO-DO: Write in detail about how the traditional population census works}

Conducting a traditional census typically requires a significant investment in resources. For instance, the 2020 U.S. Census cost around \$14 billion, covering personnel, technology, and data processing \cite{UsaCensusCost}. These costs often increase with the complexity and size of a country's population, as well as with efforts to ensure inclusivity and accurate counting, especially in remote or hard-to-reach areas.
